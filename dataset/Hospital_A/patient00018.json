        "admission_note": "# Admission Note\n\n**Patient:** John Doe\n**Age:** 44\n**Sex:** Male\n**Date:** 2024-02-29\n\n## History of Present Illness (HPI):\n\nMr. Doe is a 44-year-old male presenting with a 3-day history of progressive dyspnea, worse with exertion and when supine (orthopnea). He also reports a non-productive cough. He denies fever, chills, chest pain, recent trauma, or significant changes in his diet. He notes mild bilateral ankle edema that has developed over the past few days.\n\n## Past Medical History (PMH):\n\n*   Hypertension (well-controlled on lisinopril)\n*   Hyperlipidemia (treated with atorvastatin)\n\n## Social History (SH):\n\n*   Accountant\n*   Denies smoking, alcohol, or illicit drug use.\n\n## Family History (FH):\n\n*   Father with coronary artery disease.\n\n## Review of Systems (ROS):\n\n*   **Constitutional:** Denies fever, chills, weight loss.\n*   **Cardiovascular:** Denies chest pain, palpitations. Reports ankle edema.\n*   **Respiratory:** Reports dyspnea, non-productive cough, orthopnea.\n*   **Gastrointestinal:** Denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain.\n*   **Neurological:** Denies headache, dizziness, weakness, numbness.\n\n## Physical Examination:\n\n*   **General:** Alert and oriented, appears mildly distressed due to dyspnea.\n*   **Vitals:** HR 98 bpm, BP 135/88 mmHg, RR 22 breaths/min, SpO2 92% on room air, Temp 37.0\u00b0C.\n*   **HEENT:** Normocephalic, atraumatic. Mucous membranes moist. No JVD noted at rest.\n*   **Cardiovascular:** Regular rate and rhythm. S1 and S2 auscultated. No murmurs, rubs, or gallops appreciated.\n*   **Respiratory:** Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally, but breath sounds are diminished at the bases. No wheezes or crackles noted.\n*   **Abdomen:** Soft, non-tender, non-distended. Bowel sounds present in all four quadrants.\n*   **Extremities:** Mild (1+) bilateral pitting edema in the ankles.\n\n## Investigations:\n\n*   **Chest X-ray:** Shows a moderate right-sided pleural effusion. No evidence of consolidation or pulmonary edema.\n\n## Assessment:\n\n1.  **Dyspnea and Pleural Effusion:** The patient's presentation of progressive dyspnea, orthopnea, non-productive cough, and ankle edema, along with the finding of a pleural effusion on chest X-ray, is highly suggestive of congestive heart failure (CHF). While the X-ray does not show overt pulmonary edema, pleural effusions are a common finding in CHF, often occurring due to increased hydrostatic pressure.\n\n## Plan:\n\n1.  **Admit to Cardiology service:** For further evaluation and management of suspected CHF.\n2.  **Oxygen:** Administer supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula to maintain SpO2 > 92%.\n3.  **Labs:** Order comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), complete blood count (CBC), brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), troponin, and coagulation studies.\n4.  **ECG:** Obtain a 12-lead ECG to assess for ischemia or arrhythmias.\n5.  **Echocardiogram:** Order an echocardiogram to evaluate cardiac structure and function (ejection fraction, diastolic function, valvular disease).\n6.  **Diuretics:** Initiate intravenous furosemide (Lasix) 40 mg IV now, and potentially increase dose based on response and weight.\n7.  **Fluid Restriction:** Implement fluid restriction (e.g., 2L/day).\n8.  **Monitor:** Closely monitor vital signs, oxygen saturation, respiratory status, and urine output. Daily weights.\n9.  **Consult Cardiology:** Request urgent cardiology consultation for further management and potential workup for underlying etiology (e.g., ischemic heart disease).\n",
