He states his symptoms began gradually but have progressed significantly today, making it difficult to walk even short distances. He denies recent travel, sick contacts, or known exposure to tuberculosis. He is a former smoker, having quit 20 years ago after a 30 pack-year history. He takes lisinopril, atorvastatin, and metformin. He denies recent falls or trauma. He reports orthopnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea for the past several months, which he attributes to his age.

The onset was gradual, but symptoms have significantly worsened today. He describes the dyspnea as exertional, limiting his ability to walk short distances. He also reports a non-productive cough. He denies fever, chills, chest pain, recent travel, sick contacts, or known TB exposure. He denies recent falls or trauma. He reports orthopnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea (PND) for several months, which he previously attributed to age. He denies lower extremity edema.\n\n## Past Medical History\n\n*   Hypertension\n*   Hyperlipidemia\n*   Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus\n*   Former smoker (30 pack-years, quit 20 years ago)\n\n## Medications\n\n*   Lisinopril\n*   Atorvastatin\n*   Metformin\n\n## Allergies\n\nNKDA\n\n## Social History\n\nFormer smoker. Denies alcohol or illicit drug use.\n\n## Family History\n\nNon-contributory.\n\n## Review of Systems\n\n*   **Constitutional:** Denies fever, chills, weight loss.\n*   **Cardiovascular:** Denies chest pain. Reports orthopnea and PND.\n*   **Respiratory:** Reports worsening shortness of breath, non-productive cough.\n*   **Gastrointestinal:** Denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain.\n*   **Genitourinary:** Denies dysuria, frequency, urgency.\n*   **Neurological:** Denies headache, dizziness, focal weakness.\n*   **Musculoskeletal:** Denies joint pain, muscle weakness.\n*   **Skin:** Denies rash, itching.\n\n## Physical Examination\n\n**General:** Elderly male, appears anxious and in moderate respiratory distress.\n**Vitals:** HR 115 bpm, BP 140/85 mmHg, SpO2 90% on room air, Temp 37.0\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F).\n**HEENT:** Normocephalic, atraumatic. Mucous membranes slightly dry. No JVD noted at rest.\n**Neck:** Supple. No thyromegaly or lymphadenopathy.\n**Lungs:** Auscultation reveals bilateral crackles, predominantly at the bases. Decreased breath sounds noted bilaterally.\n**Cardiovascular:** Tachycardic, regular rhythm. S1 and S2 present. No murmurs, rubs, or gallops appreciated.\n**Abdomen:** Soft, non-tender, non-distended. Bowel sounds present in all four quadrants.\n**Extremities:** No peripheral edema noted. Skin is warm and dry. Pulses 2+ bilaterally.\n**Neurological:** Alert and oriented to person, place, and time. Grossly intact motor and sensory function.\n\n## Investigations\n\n*   **Chest X-ray:** Shows cardiomegaly. No pleural effusion identified. Further evaluation pending (e.g., BNP, ECG, Troponin).\n\n## Assessment\n\n1.  **Acute Decompensated Heart Failure (ADHF):** The patient's presentation with worsening dyspnea, orthopnea, PND, bibasilar crackles, tachycardia, and hypoxia, along with a history of hypertension and diabetes, is highly suggestive of ADHF. The chest X-ray finding of cardiomegaly supports this diagnosis. The absence of pleural effusion does not rule out ADHF.\n\n## Plan\n\n1.  **Oxygen Therapy:** Initiate supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula to maintain SpO2 > 92%.\n2.  **Cardiac Monitoring:** Place patient on continuous cardiac monitoring.\n3.  **IV Access:** Establish intravenous access.\n4.  **Medications:**\n    *   Administer intravenous furosemide (Lasix) for diuresis.\n    *   Consider nitroglycerin drip for preload/afterload reduction if BP allows.\n    *   Administer morphine sulfate for symptom relief (dyspnea, anxiety) cautiously.\n5.  **Labs:** Order stat labs including CBC, BMP, BNP, Troponin, and coagulation studies.\n6.  **ECG:** Obtain a 12-lead ECG to evaluate for ischemia, arrhythmias, or signs of left ventricular hypertrophy.\n7.  **Consult Cardiology:** Consult cardiology for further evaluation and management.\n8.  **Continuous Monitoring:** Closely monitor vital signs, respiratory status, urine output, and response to treatment.\n9.  **Further Imaging:** Consider echocardiogram to assess cardiac function and structure once stabilized.\n",
