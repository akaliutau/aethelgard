She also reports a productive cough with yellowish sputum, chills, and generalized weakness. She denies chest pain, palpitations, or lower extremity swelling. Symptoms began gradually and have worsened over the past 72 hours.\n\n## Past Medical History\n\n*   Hypertension\n*   Osteoarthritis\n*   Chronic Kidney Disease Stage 3\n\n## Medications\n\n*   Lisinopril\n*   Acetaminophen\n*   Multivitamin\n\n## Allergies\n\nNKDA\n\n## Social History\n\nNon-smoker. Denies alcohol or illicit drug use. Lives at home with home health aide.\n\n## Family History\n\nNon-contributory.\n\n## Review of Systems\n\n*   **Constitutional:** Reports chills, weakness.\n*   **Respiratory:** Reports shortness of breath, productive cough (yellowish sputum).\n*   **Cardiovascular:** Denies chest pain, palpitations, edema.\n*   **Gastrointestinal:** Denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain.\n*   **Neurological:** Denies headache, dizziness, focal weakness.\n\n## Physical Examination\n\n*   **General:** Elderly female, appears acutely ill, slightly diaphoretic.\n*   **Vitals:** HR 115 bpm, BP 90/60 mmHg, SpO2 88% on room air, Temp 38.5\u00b0C (101.3\u00b0F).\n*   **HEENT:** Mucous membranes slightly dry. No obvious signs of trauma.\n*   **Neck:** Supple, no lymphadenopathy or thyroid enlargement.\n*   **Lungs:** Auscultation reveals crackles and bronchial breath sounds in the right lower lobe. Decreased breath sounds noted diffusely bilaterally, possibly due to age-related changes or underlying lung disease. Increased work of breathing, including accessory muscle use.\n*   **Cardiovascular:** Tachycardic, regular rhythm. No murmurs, rubs, or gallops appreciated. Peripheral pulses 2+ bilaterally.\n*   **Abdomen:** Soft, non-tender, non-distended. Bowel sounds present in all four quadrants.\n*   **Neurological:** Alert and oriented to person, place, and time. Gross motor and sensory function intact.\n*   **Skin:** Warm, dry, slightly diaphoretic. No rashes or lesions noted.\n\n## Investigations\n\n*   **Chest X-ray:** (Findings pending, but clinical suspicion high for pneumonia given presentation and exam)\n*   CBC, CMP, Lactate, Blood Cultures, Sputum Culture\n\n## Assessment\n\n1.  **Hypotension and Tachycardia:** Likely secondary to sepsis/infection.\n2.  **Hypoxemia:** SpO2 88% on room air, consistent with respiratory compromise.\n3.  **Fever and Chills:** Suggestive of an infectious process.\n4.  **Productive Cough, Shortness of Breath, Crackles/Bronchial Breath Sounds:** Highly suggestive of pneumonia, likely right lower lobe.\n5.  **Possible Sepsis:** Given hypotension, tachycardia, fever, and likely source of infection (pneumonia).\n\n## Plan\n\n1.  **Admit to Medical Floor/ICU:** Given age, comorbidities, vital sign instability (hypotension, tachycardia, hypoxemia), and suspected sepsis.\n2.  **Oxygen Therapy:** Initiate supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula or mask to maintain SpO2 > 90%.\n3.  **IV Fluids:** Start IV fluids (e.g., Normal Saline) for resuscitation given hypotension.\n4.  **Antibiotics:** Initiate broad-spectrum IV antibiotics (e.g., Ceftriaxone + Azithromycin) empirically for community-acquired pneumonia, pending culture results.\n5.  **Labs:** Obtain CBC, CMP, Lactate, Blood Cultures, Sputum Culture, Urinalysis.\n6.  **Cardiac Monitoring:** Continuous cardiac monitoring due to tachycardia and potential for arrhythmia.\n7.  **Frequent Vitals:** Monitor vital signs closely (q15min initially, then q1-2h).\n8.  **Consider Vasopressors:** If hypotension persists despite fluid resuscitation.\n9.  **Chest X-ray:** Review chest x-ray results when available to confirm pneumonia and rule out other pathology.\n10. **Consult Respiratory Therapy:** For potential need for non-invasive ventilation if respiratory status worsens.\n11. **Monitor Urine Output:** Due to CKD and potential for acute kidney injury.\n",
