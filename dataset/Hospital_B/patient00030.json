Symptoms have progressively worsened over the last 24 hours, significantly impacting his ability to breathe comfortably and speak. He denies chest pain, recent travel, or known sick contacts.\n\n## Past Medical History (PMH):\n\n*   Hypertension\n*   Hyperlipidemia\n*   COPD (on home O2 2L NC)\n*   40 pack-year smoking history (quit 10 years ago)\n\n## Medications:\n\n*   Albuterol PRN\n*   Tiotropium daily\n*   Lisinopril\n*   Atorvastatin\n\n## Allergies:\n\nNKDA\n\n## Social History:\n\nFormer smoker, lives at home with wife.\n\n## Family History:\n\nNon-contributory.\n\n## Review of Systems (ROS):\n\n*   **Constitutional:** Fever, chills, malaise.\n*   **Respiratory:** Worsening shortness of breath, productive cough (yellow sputum).\n*   **Cardiovascular:** Denies chest pain, palpitations.\n*   **Gastrointestinal:** Denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain.\n*   **Neurological:** Denies headache, dizziness, focal weakness.\n\n## Physical Examination:\n\n*   **General:** Elderly male, appears acutely ill, diaphoretic.\n*   **Vitals:** HR 115 bpm, BP 130/80 mmHg, SpO2 88% on room air, Temp 38.5\u00b0C (101.3\u00b0F).\n*   **HEENT:** Mucous membranes slightly dry. Pharynx clear.\n*   **Neck:** Supple, no lymphadenopathy.\n*   **Lungs:** Auscultation reveals decreased breath sounds and coarse crackles in the right lower lobe. Increased work of breathing with accessory muscle use.\n*   **Cardiovascular:** Tachycardic, regular rhythm. No murmurs, rubs, or gallops.\n*   **Abdomen:** Soft, non-tender, non-distended. Bowel sounds present.\n*   **Extremities:** No edema, cyanosis, or clubbing.\n*   **Neurological:** Alert and oriented x3. Grossly intact motor and sensory function.\n\n## Investigations:\n\n*   **Chest X-ray:** Shows consolidation in the right lower lobe.\n*   **Labs:** Pending (CBC, CMP, ABG, Blood Cultures, Sputum Gram Stain/Culture).\n\n## Assessment:\n\n1.  **Community-Acquired Pneumonia (CAP):** Based on the patient's presentation (fever, chills, productive cough, shortness of breath), physical exam findings (crackles, decreased breath sounds in RLL), and chest X-ray showing consolidation in the right lower lobe. His COPD and age are risk factors for severe disease.\n2.  **Hypoxemia:** Secondary to pneumonia and underlying COPD.\n3.  **Tachycardia:** Likely secondary to fever, hypoxemia, and underlying illness.\n\n## Plan:\n\n1.  **Admit to Medicine:** For management of CAP.\n2.  **Oxygen Therapy:** Titrate to maintain SpO2 >90% (likely requiring supplemental O2 >2L NC, possibly non-rebreather or BiPAP if needed).\n3.  **Antibiotics:** Initiate empiric antibiotic therapy for CAP (e.g., Ceftriaxone + Azithromycin or Levofloxacin), pending culture results.\n4.  **IV Fluids:** Administer IV fluids for hydration.\n5.  **Bronchodilators:** Continue home regimen (albuterol/ipratropium) as needed for COPD exacerbation component.\n6.  **Corticosteroids:** Consider systemic corticosteroids for COPD exacerbation component, especially given severity.\n7.  **Monitoring:** Continuous cardiac monitoring, frequent vital sign checks, serial SpO2 monitoring, respiratory status assessment.\n8.  **Labs:** Obtain CBC, CMP, ABG, Blood Cultures, Sputum Gram Stain/Culture.\n9.  **Consults:** Consider Pulmonary consult if respiratory status deteriorates or fails to improve.\n10. **Incentive Spirometry:** Encourage use.\n",
