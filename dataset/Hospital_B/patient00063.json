She reports feeling feverish and experiencing chills. Her symptoms began gradually but have progressively worsened over the past 48 hours. She denies recent travel, sick contacts, or known exposure to tuberculosis. She denies lower extremity edema or orthopnea.\n\n## Past Medical History\n\n*   Hypertension\n*   Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus\n*   Osteoarthritis\n*   Former smoker (quit 15 years ago, 20 pack-year history)\n\n## Medications\n\n*   Lisinopril\n*   Metformin\n*   Acetaminophen PRN\n\n## Allergies\n\n*   NKDA\n\n## Social History\n\n*   Lives at home with her husband.\n*   Independent in ADLs.\n*   Former smoker.\n\n## Family History\n\n*   Non-contributory\n\n## Review of Systems\n\n*   **Constitutional:** Fever, chills, malaise.\n*   **Respiratory:** Shortness of breath, productive cough (purulent sputum), pleuritic chest pain.\n*   **Cardiovascular:** Denies chest pain (other than pleuritic), palpitations, edema.\n*   **Gastrointestinal:** Denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain.\n*   **Neurological:** Denies headache, dizziness, focal weakness.\n\n## Physical Examination\n\n*   **General:** Elderly female, appears acutely ill, in mild respiratory distress.\n*   **Vitals:** HR 115 bpm, BP 105/68 mmHg, SpO2 88% on room air, Temp 38.5\u00b0C (101.3\u00b0F).\n*   **HEENT:** Atraumatic, mucous membranes slightly dry.\n*   **Neck:** Supple, no lymphadenopathy or JVD.\n*   **Lungs:** Decreased breath sounds and dullness to percussion over the right lower lobe. Crackles auscultated over the right lower lobe. Left lung is clear to auscultation.\n*   **Cardiovascular:** Tachycardic, regular rhythm, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. No peripheral edema.\n*   **Abdomen:** Soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present.\n*   **Neurological:** Alert and oriented x3, no focal deficits.\n*   **Skin:** Warm, dry, no rashes.\n\n## Investigations\n\n*   **Chest X-ray:** Shows consolidation in the right lower lobe and a moderate right-sided pleural effusion.\n*   **Labs:** Pending CBC, CMP, BNP, Lactate, Blood Cultures, Sputum Gram Stain and Culture.\n\n## Assessment\n\n1.  **Community-Acquired Pneumonia (CAP) with Parapneumonic Effusion:** The patient's presentation with fever, chills, productive cough, pleuritic chest pain, shortness of breath, and physical exam findings (decreased breath sounds, dullness, crackles in the right lower lobe) are highly suggestive of pneumonia. The chest X-ray confirms consolidation and a pleural effusion, consistent with CAP complicated by a parapneumonic effusion. Her vital signs (tachycardia, hypotension, hypoxia, fever) indicate significant illness.\n\n## Plan\n\n1.  **Admit to Medical Floor:** Given her age, comorbidities, hypoxia, and signs of systemic illness, admission is warranted.\n2.  **Oxygen Therapy:** Initiate supplemental oxygen to maintain SpO2 > 92%.\n3.  **IV Fluids:** Start IV fluids (e.g., Normal Saline) for hydration and potential hypotension.\n4.  **Antibiotics:** Initiate empiric IV antibiotics covering typical and atypical CAP pathogens (e.g., Ceftriaxone + Azithromycin or Levofloxacin). Adjust based on sputum culture results.\n5.  **Pain Management:** Provide analgesia for pleuritic chest pain (e.g., NSAIDs or acetaminophen).\n6.  **Monitor:** Closely monitor vital signs, respiratory status, oxygen saturation, and urine output.\n7.  **Further Investigations:** Obtain CBC, CMP, BNP, Lactate, Blood Cultures, Sputum Gram Stain and Culture. Consider CT chest if clinical status worsens or effusion does not resolve.\n8.  **Thoracentesis:** Consider diagnostic and potentially therapeutic thoracentesis if the effusion is large or if empyema is suspected based on clinical course or imaging.\n9.  **Consult:** Consider Pulmonary consult if needed.\n\n## Prognosis\n\nPrognosis depends on the severity of the pneumonia, response to treatment, and presence of complications. Close monitoring and appropriate management are crucial.",
