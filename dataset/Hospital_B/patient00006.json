The pain is described as sudden and severe. She denies any preceding trauma, cough, fever, chills, or sputum production. She reports feeling lightheaded and dizzy upon arrival.\n\n## Past Medical History\n\nWell-controlled asthma (uses albuterol PRN).\n\n## Allergies\n\nNKDA\n\n## Medications\n\nAlbuterol inhaler (PRN).\n\n## Social History\n\nOccasional alcohol use. No tobacco use. No illicit drug use.\n\n## Family History\n\nNon-contributory.\n\n## Review of Systems\n\n*   **Constitutional:** Denies fever, chills, weight loss.\n*   **Respiratory:** Reports acute onset shortness of breath and right-sided pleuritic chest pain. Denies cough or sputum.\n*   **Cardiovascular:** Denies chest pain (other than pleuritic pain), palpitations, edema.\n*   **Gastrointestinal:** Denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain.\n*   **Neurological:** Reports dizziness.\n\n## Physical Examination\n\n*   **General:** Anxious appearing female in moderate respiratory distress.\n*   **Vitals:** HR 115 bpm, BP 105/68 mmHg, SpO2 92% on room air, Temp 37.0\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F).\n*   **HEENT:** Atraumatic. Mucous membranes slightly dry.\n*   **Neck:** Supple, no JVD.\n*   **Lungs:** Decreased breath sounds on the right side compared to the left. Hyperresonance to percussion on the right side. No wheezing or crackles appreciated.\n*   **Cardiovascular:** Tachycardic, regular rhythm. No murmurs, rubs, or gallops.\n*   **Abdomen:** Soft, non-tender, non-distended. Bowel sounds present.\n*   **Extremities:** No edema, cyanosis, or clubbing.\n*   **Skin:** Warm, dry, diaphoretic.\n\n## Investigations\n\n*   Chest X-ray (CXR): Ordered stat. (Results pending, but clinical suspicion high for pneumothorax)\n\n## Assessment\n\n1.  **Acute Respiratory Distress:** Likely secondary to underlying pulmonary pathology.\n2.  **Right-sided Pleuritic Chest Pain:** Suggestive of pleural irritation or inflammation.\n3.  **Tachycardia and Hypoxia:** Indicative of significant physiological compromise.\n4.  **High Suspicion for Spontaneous Pneumothorax:** Based on acute onset pleuritic chest pain, shortness of breath, decreased breath sounds, and hyperresonance on the right side in a relatively young, non-smoking female with a history of asthma (though asthma itself is not a direct risk factor, some underlying lung conditions can predispose). The vital signs (tachycardia, hypoxia) support significant respiratory compromise.\n\n## Plan\n\n1.  **STAT Chest X-ray:** To confirm or rule out pneumothorax. (Assuming CXR confirms pneumothorax based on prompt)\n2.  **Supplemental Oxygen:** Apply via nasal cannula or face mask to maintain SpO2 > 94%.\n3.  **Cardiac Monitor:** Continuous monitoring due to tachycardia and potential for hemodynamic instability.\n4.  **IV Access:** Establish two large-bore IVs.\n5.  **Labs:** CBC, BMP, ABG, Coagulation studies.\n6.  **Consult Pulmonary:** For management of pneumothorax.\n7.  **Pain Management:** Consider IV analgesia for chest pain (e.g., morphine) cautiously, monitoring respiratory status.\n8.  **Prepare for Intervention:** Based on CXR findings and clinical status, prepare for potential chest tube placement if a significant pneumothorax is confirmed, especially given the patient's respiratory distress and hypoxia.\n9.  **Continuous Reassessment:** Frequent monitoring of vital signs, respiratory effort, and oxygen saturation.\n\n## Follow Up\n\nWill reassess patient's respiratory status and pain level frequently. Will review CXR results as soon as available and adjust management accordingly. Will consult pulmonary team for definitive management plan.\n",
