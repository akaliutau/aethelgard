The onset was gradual, but symptoms have significantly worsened today. She describes difficulty breathing even with minimal exertion, such as walking across the room. She also reports a non-productive cough and subjective fever. She denies chest pain, palpitations, or lower extremity edema. She has not been able to tolerate her usual oral intake due to feeling unwell.\n\n## Past Medical History\n\n*   Hypertension\n*   Osteoarthritis\n*   Chronic Kidney Disease (Stage 3)\n\n## Medications\n\n*   Lisinopril\n*   Acetaminophen PRN\n*   Multivitamin\n\n## Allergies\n\nNKDA\n\n## Social History\n\nNon-smoker. Denies alcohol use. Lives at home with daughter's assistance.\n\n## Family History\n\nNon-contributory.\n\n## Review of Systems\n\n*   **Constitutional:** Reports subjective fever, malaise.\n*   **Respiratory:** Shortness of breath, non-productive cough.\n*   **Cardiovascular:** Denies chest pain, palpitations, edema.\n*   **Gastrointestinal:** Decreased oral intake.\n*   **Neurological:** Denies focal weakness, numbness, tingling.\n\n## Physical Examination\n\n*   **General:** Elderly female, appears acutely ill, slightly diaphoretic.\n*   **Vitals:** HR 115 bpm, BP 105/68 mmHg, SpO2 88% on room air, Temp 38.2\u00b0C (100.8\u00b0F).\n*   **HEENT:** Normocephalic, atraumatic. Mucous membranes slightly dry. Oropharynx clear.\n*   **Neck:** Supple, no JVD, no lymphadenopathy.\n*   **Lungs:** Auscultation reveals bilateral crackles, predominantly in the lower lobes, more pronounced on the right side. Decreased breath sounds at the right base. Increased work of breathing with accessory muscle use.\n*   **Cardiovascular:** Tachycardic, regular rhythm. No murmurs, rubs, or gallops appreciated. No peripheral edema.\n*   **Abdomen:** Soft, non-tender, non-distended. Bowel sounds present in all four quadrants.\n*   **Neurological:** Alert and oriented to person, place, and time. Grossly intact motor strength and sensation.\n*   **Skin:** Warm, dry, no rashes or lesions noted.\n\n## Investigations\n\n*   **Chest X-ray:** Ordered and reviewed. Shows bilateral lower lobe infiltrates, more prominent on the right. There is blunting of the right costophrenic angle, suggestive of a small pleural effusion. No pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, mass, cardiomegaly, or fractured ribs are identified.\n*   **Labs:** CBC, CMP, BNP, Procalcitonin, Blood Cultures, Sputum Culture pending.\n\n## Assessment\n\n1.  **Community-Acquired Pneumonia (CAP):** Likely diagnosis given the acute onset of shortness of breath, cough, fever, tachypnea, tachycardia, hypoxia, and bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray. The patient is elderly with comorbidities (CKD, HTN), placing her at higher risk for complications.\n2.  **Possible Pleural Effusion:** Blunting of the right costophrenic angle on CXR suggests a small effusion, potentially parapneumonic.\n3.  **Hypoxia:** SpO2 88% on room air indicates significant respiratory compromise.\n4.  **Tachycardia:** HR 115 bpm likely secondary to fever, hypoxia, and underlying illness.\n5.  **Hypotension:** BP 105/68 mmHg, borderline low, potentially related to sepsis or dehydration.\n\n## Plan\n\n1.  **Admit to Medical Floor:** Given the patient's age, comorbidities, hypoxia, tachycardia, and likely diagnosis of CAP, admission is warranted for further management and monitoring.\n2.  **Oxygen Therapy:** Initiate supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula to maintain SpO2 > 92%.\n3.  **IV Fluids:** Start IV fluids (e.g., Normal Saline) for hydration and potential hypotension.\n4.  **Antibiotics:** Initiate empiric IV antibiotics for CAP (e.g., Ceftriaxone and Azithromycin) after obtaining cultures.\n5.  **Monitoring:** Continuous cardiac monitoring, frequent vital sign checks, and pulse oximetry monitoring.\n6.  **Further Investigations:** Await lab results (CBC, CMP, BNP, Procalcitonin, Cultures). Consider CT chest if clinical picture worsens or does not improve with initial treatment, or if complications like empyema are suspected.\n7.  **Respiratory Support:** Assess need for non-invasive ventilation (NIV) or intubation if respiratory distress worsens despite oxygen therapy.\n8.  **Consults:** Consider Pulmonary consult if needed.\n9.  **DVT Prophylaxis:** Initiate DVT prophylaxis (e.g., subcutaneous heparin) due to immobility.\n10. **Pain Management:** Acetaminophen PRN for fever/discomfort.\n",
