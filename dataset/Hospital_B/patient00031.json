He describes the shortness of breath as worsening with exertion and lying flat (orthopnea). He also reports increased fatigue and weakness. He denies chest pain, fever, chills, or productive cough. He admits to recent dietary indiscretion (increased sodium intake) and inconsistent use of his prescribed furosemide. He denies recent travel or sick contacts.\n\n## Past Medical History (PMH)\n\n*   Hypertension\n*   Hyperlipidemia\n*   Atrial Fibrillation (on warfarin)\n*   Chronic Kidney Disease (Stage III)\n*   History of falls\n\n## Medications\n\n*   Lisinopril\n*   Atorvastatin\n*   Warfarin\n*   Furosemide (PRN, admits to inconsistent use)\n\n## Allergies\n\nNKDA\n\n## Social History\n\nLives alone. Denies smoking or alcohol use.\n\n## Family History\n\nNon-contributory.\n\n## Review of Systems (ROS)\n\n*   **General:** Fatigue, weakness.\n*   **HEENT:** Negative.\n*   **Cardiovascular:** Denies chest pain. Reports orthopnea.\n*   **Respiratory:** Shortness of breath, denies cough.\n*   **Gastrointestinal:** Negative.\n*   **Genitourinary:** Reports ankle swelling.\n*   **Neurological:** Negative.\n*   **Musculoskeletal:** Negative.\n*   **Skin:** Negative.\n\n## Physical Examination\n\n*   **General:** Elderly male, appears fatigued, slightly diaphoretic.\n*   **Vitals:** HR 115 bpm, BP 140/90 mmHg, RR 24 breaths/min, SpO2 90% on room air, Temp 37.0\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F).\n*   **HEENT:** Normocephalic, atraumatic. Mucous membranes slightly dry. JVP elevated at 8 cm.\n*   **Cardiovascular:** Tachycardic, regular rhythm (consistent with known A-fib, rate likely uncontrolled). S1 and S2 present. No murmurs, rubs, or gallops appreciated.\n*   **Respiratory:** Tachypneic. Lungs reveal bilateral crackles, predominantly at the bases. Decreased breath sounds at the bases bilaterally, possibly due to atelectasis or pleural effusions. No wheezing noted.\n*   **Abdomen:** Soft, non-tender, non-distended. Bowel sounds present in all four quadrants.\n*   **Extremities:** 2+ pitting edema bilaterally up to the mid-shins.\n*   **Neurological:** Alert and oriented x3. Grossly intact motor and sensory function.\n\n## Assessment\n\n1.  **Acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF):** Likely secondary to medication non-compliance (furosemide) and dietary indiscretion (high sodium intake). Clinical presentation includes worsening dyspnea, orthopnea, elevated JVP, bilateral crackles, peripheral edema, and tachycardia. Hypoxia (SpO2 90%) is also present.\n2.  **Atrial Fibrillation:** Rate appears uncontrolled (HR 115), contributing to symptoms.\n3.  **Chronic Kidney Disease (Stage III):** Relevant PMH, may impact diuretic response and fluid management.\n\n## Plan\n\n1.  **Immediate:**\n    *   Place patient on supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula to maintain SpO2 > 92%.\n    *   Establish IV access.\n    *   Obtain stat ECG, BMP, BNP, CBC, coagulation studies (PT/INR).\n    *   Obtain chest X-ray (already done, shows edema, possible atelectasis).\n2.  **Medical Management:**\n    *   Administer IV loop diuretic (e.g., furosemide) for volume overload.\n    *   Consider IV vasodilator (e.g., nitroglycerin) if BP allows, for afterload reduction and symptom relief.\n    *   Initiate or adjust rate control medication for atrial fibrillation (e.g., metoprolol, diltiazem) if hemodynamically stable.\n    *   Monitor urine output closely.\n    *   Monitor electrolytes and renal function.\n3.  **Further Evaluation:**\n    *   Assess response to initial therapy.\n    *   Consider echocardiogram to evaluate cardiac function if not recently performed.\n    *   Consult cardiology if needed.\n4.  **Disposition:**\n    *   Admit to telemetry unit for monitoring and management of ADHF and atrial fibrillation.\n\n## Orders\n\n*   O2 NC to maintain SpO2 > 92%\n*   IVF 1000 mL NS KVO\n*   Furosemide 40 mg IV push now, then 40 mg IV BID\n*   ECG STAT\n*   BMP, CBC, BNP, Coags STAT\n*   Chest X-ray (already done)\n*   Telemetry monitoring\n*   Strict I&O\n*   Daily weights\n*   Diet: Sodium restriction (2g)\n*   Consult Cardiology\n",
