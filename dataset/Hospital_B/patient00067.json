The cough is productive of thick, greenish-yellow sputum. She reports feeling feverish and experiencing chills over the past 48 hours. She denies recent travel or sick contacts. Past medical history is significant for hypertension, well-controlled with lisinopril, and seasonal allergies. She is a non-smoker and denies illicit drug use. She drinks alcohol occasionally (1-2 glasses of wine per week). She reports being up-to-date on her vaccinations, including the annual influenza vaccine and pneumococcal vaccine (PPSV23) 5 years ago.

It began with a dry cough and mild fatigue, which progressed over the last 48 hours to include a productive cough with thick, greenish-yellow sputum, significant shortness of breath, and sharp, pleuritic chest pain localized to the right lower chest. She reports subjective fevers and chills. She denies any recent travel, sick contacts, or known exposures. She denies any recent hospitalization or antibiotic use.\n\n## Review of Systems (ROS)\n\n*   **Constitutional:** Reports fever, chills, fatigue.\n*   **Respiratory:** Productive cough (greenish-yellow sputum), shortness of breath, pleuritic chest pain (right side).\n*   **Cardiovascular:** Denies chest pain (other than pleuritic), palpitations, edema.\n*   **Gastrointestinal:** Denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain.\n*   **Neurological:** Denies headache, dizziness, focal weakness.\n\n## Past Medical History (PMH)\n\n*   Hypertension (well-controlled on lisinopril)\n*   Seasonal allergies\n\n## Medications\n\n*   Lisinopril 10mg daily\n*   Over-the-counter loratadine as needed for allergies\n\n## Allergies\n\n*   NKDA (No Known Drug Allergies)\n\n## Social History\n\n*   Non-smoker\n*   Occasional alcohol use (1-2 glasses of wine/week)\n*   No illicit drug use\n*   Works as a librarian\n\n## Family History\n\n*   Non-contributory\n\n## Physical Examination\n\n*   **General:** Appears acutely ill, slightly diaphoretic.\n*   **Vitals:** HR 115 bpm, BP 110/70 mmHg, SpO2 90% on room air, Temp 38.5\u00b0C (101.3\u00b0F).\n*   **HEENT:** Mucous membranes slightly dry, pharynx clear.\n*   **Neck:** Supple, no lymphadenopathy.\n*   **Lungs:** Auscultation reveals decreased breath sounds and coarse crackles over the right lower lobe. Egophony is present in the same area. Left lung is clear to auscultation.\n*   **Cardiovascular:** Tachycardic, regular rhythm, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.\n*   **Abdomen:** Soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present.\n*   **Skin:** Warm, dry, no rashes.\n*   **Neurological:** Alert and oriented x3, no focal deficits.\n\n## Investigations\n\n*   **Chest X-ray (CXR):** Shows consolidation in the right lower lobe.\n*   **CBC:** Pending.\n*   **BMP:** Pending.\n*   **Influenza/COVID PCR:** Pending.\n*   **Blood Cultures:** Pending.\n*   **Sputum Gram Stain and Culture:** Pending.\n\n## Assessment\n\n1.  **Community-Acquired Pneumonia (CAP), likely bacterial, involving the right lower lobe.** The patient presents with classic symptoms (fever, productive cough, pleuritic chest pain, shortness of breath) and physical exam findings (tachycardia, tachypnea, hypoxemia, decreased breath sounds, crackles, egophony) consistent with pneumonia. The CXR confirms consolidation in the right lower lobe.\n\n## Plan\n\n1.  **Admit to the hospital (Medical Floor).** Patient requires supplemental oxygen, intravenous antibiotics, and monitoring due to hypoxemia and tachycardia.\n2.  **Oxygen Therapy:** Start supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula to maintain SpO2 > 92%.\n3.  **Intravenous Fluids:** Start IV fluids (e.g., Normal Saline) at 100 mL/hr for hydration.\n4.  **Antibiotics:** Initiate empiric antibiotic therapy for CAP. Given the likely bacterial etiology and severity (hypoxemia), start with a combination regimen covering typical and atypical pathogens. Options include:\n    *   Ceftriaxone 2g IV daily PLUS Azithromycin 500mg IV daily\n    *   OR Levofloxacin 750mg IV daily (if no contraindications).\n5.  **Antipyretics:** Administer acetaminophen or ibuprofen for fever and discomfort.\n6.  **Sputum Culture:** Obtain sputum sample for Gram stain and culture/sensitivity.\n7.  **Blood Cultures:** Obtain two sets of blood cultures.\n8.  **Influenza/COVID Testing:** Await results to guide further management.\n9.  **Monitor:** Closely monitor vital signs, respiratory status, and oxygen saturation. Repeat CXR if clinically indicated (e.g., worsening symptoms, failure to improve).\n10. **Consider DVT prophylaxis:** Given admission and potential immobility.\n11. **Consult Respiratory Therapy:** For potential nebulizer treatments if needed.\n",
