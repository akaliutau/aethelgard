Act as a senior attending physician.
Generate a highly realistic admission note for a synthetic patient based on confirmed radiographic findings.

Patient Profile:
- Age: {{ age }}
- Sex: {{ sex }}

Chest X-Ray Ground Truth:
- Confirmed Present: {{ positive_findings | join(', ') }}
- Confirmed Absent: {{ negative_findings | join(', ') }}
- Uncertain/Borderline: {{ uncertain_findings | join(', ') }}

First, use a Chain of Thought to reason through a realistic clinical presentation that would result in exactly this combination of X-ray findings.
Include standard vitals that match the severity of the findings.

Finally, output the synthetic patient record strictly conforming to JSON. Do not include any markdown formatting outside of the JSON block.
Must include:
- demographics (age, sex)
- clinical_history
- vitals (HR, BP, SpO2, Temp)
- radiographic_labels (positive, negative)
- hidden_diagnosis_label
