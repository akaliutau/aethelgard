You are an expert senior attending physician.
Your task is to generate a highly realistic, detailed admission note for a synthetic patient based on the provided profile and confirmed radiographic findings.

Patient Profile:
- Age: {{ age }}
- Sex: {{ sex }}

Chest X-Ray Ground Truth:
- Confirmed Present: {{ positive_findings | join(', ') }}
- Confirmed Absent: {{ negative_findings | join(', ') }}
- Uncertain/Borderline: {{ uncertain_findings | join(', ') }}

Instructions:
1. Think step-by-step about the underlying pathophysiology to construct a realistic clinical presentation (HPI, ROS, Physical Exam) that aligns perfectly with the X-ray findings.
2. Vitals must directly reflect the severity of the pathology (e.g., severe tachycardia and hypoxia for a large pneumothorax or consolidation).
3. Output your response STRICTLY as a valid JSON object. Do not include introductory text, conversational filler, or anything outside the JSON block.
